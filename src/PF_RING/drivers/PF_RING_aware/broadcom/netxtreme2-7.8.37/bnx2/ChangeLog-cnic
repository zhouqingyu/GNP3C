    bnx2x, bnx2fc: Use per port max exchange resources
    
    The firmware supports a maximum of 4K FCoE exchanges. In 4-port devices,
    or when working in multi-function mode, this resource needs to be distributed
    between the various possible FCoE functions.
    
    This information needs to be calculated by bnx2x and propagated into bnx2fc
    via cnic. bnx2fc can then use this value to calculate corresponding xid
    resources instead of using global constants.

    cnic, bnx2x: Add CNIC_DRV_STATE_HANDLES_IRQ to ethdev->drv_state
    
    In INTA mode, cnic and bnx2x share the same IRQ.  During chip reset,
    for example, cnic will stop servicing IRQs after it has shutdown the
    cnic hardware resources.  However, the shared IRQ is still active as
    bnx2x needs to finish the reset.  There is a window when bnx2x does
    not know that cnic is no longer handling IRQ and things don't always
    work properly.
    
    Add a flag to tell bnx2x that cnic is handling IRQ.  The flag is set
    before the first cnic IRQ is expected and cleared when no more cnic
    IRQs are expected, so there should be no race conditions.

    bnx2x,cnic: use FW 7.8.2
    
    This patch moves the bnx2x and cnic drivers into using FW 7.8.2
    which was recently submitted into the linux-firmware tree.
    
    A short summary of minor bugs fixed by this FW:
     1. In switch dependent mode, fix several issues regarding inner vlan
        vs. DCB priorities.
     2. iSCSI - not all packets were completed on a forward channel.
     3. DCB - fixed for 4-port devices.
     4. Fixed false parity reported in CAM memories when operating near -5%
        on the 1.0V core supply.
     5. ETS default settings are set to fairness between traffic classes
        (rather than strict priority), and uses the same chip receive buffer
        configuration for both PFC and pause.
    
    For a complete list of fixes made by this FW, see commit 236367db
    in the linux-firmware git repository.

    cnic: Fix occasional NULL pointer dereference during reboot.
    
    We register with bnx2x before we allocate ctx_tbl structure, so it is
    possible for bnx2x to call cnic_ctl before the structure is allocated.
    This can sometimes cause NULL pointer dereference of cp->ctx_tbl.  We
    fix this by adding simple checking for valid state before proceeding.
    The cnic_ctl call is RCU protected so we don't have to deal with race
    conditions.
    
    Because of the additional checking, we need to finish the shutdown
    before clearing the CNIC_UP flag.

    cnic: Improve error recovery on bnx2x devices
    
    When a bnx2x device encounters parity errors, it will not respond to all
    SPQ messages.  As a result, the shutdown sequence before reset can take
    a long time as the ulp drivers (bnx2i/bnx2fc) have to wait for timeout
    of all such messages.
    
    To improve this scenario, when bnx2x returns error on the SPQ, we'll send
    an immediate response to the ulp drivers to avoid such lengthy timeouts.
    
    Adjust the return code of relevant functions to return error only if
    the message cannot be sent on the SPQ so that we'll generate an error
    completion to the ulp drivers.

    New 7.0 FW: bnx2x, cnic, bnx2i, bnx2fc
    
    New FW/HSI (7.0):
     - Added support to 578xx chips
     - Improved HSI - much less driver's direct access to the FW internal
       memory needed.
    
    New implementation of the HSI handling layer in the bnx2x (bnx2x_sp.c):
     - Introduced chip dependent objects that have chip independent interfaces
       for configuration of MACs, multicast addresses, Rx mode, indirection table,
       fast path queues and function initialization/cleanup.
     - Objects functionality is based on the private function pointers, which
       allows not only a per-chip but also PF/VF differentiation while still
       preserving the same interface towards the driver.
     - Objects interface is not influenced by the HSI changes which do not require
       providing new parameters keeping the code outside the bnx2x_sp.c invariant
       with regard to such HSI chnages.
    
    Changes in a CNIC, bnx2fc and bnx2i modules due to the new HSI.

    cnic: Improve NETDEV_UP event handling
    
    During NETDEV_UP, we use symbol_get() to get the net driver's cnic

    right after NETDEV_REGISTER and the net driver is still running module
    init code.  As a result, the cnic device may not be discovered.  We

    cnic: Fix rtnl deadlock
    
    When cnic_stop_hw() -> cnic_cm_stop_bnx2x_hw() is called under rtnl_lock()
    from NETDEV_DOWN event, it waits for cnic_delete_task() to complete.
    It will deadlock when cnic_delete_task() takes rtnl_lock() before
    calling cnic_ulp_stop_one().
    
    We fix it by removing the rtnl_lock() in cnic_delete_task().
    cnic_ulp_stop_one() has mutex and atomic bit ops to prevent important
    operations from being done more than once, so it is not necessary to take

    Move all shared mem code to bnx2x to avoid code duplication.  bnx2x now
    performs:
    
    - Read the FCoE and iSCSI max connection information.
    - Read the iSCSI and FCoE MACs from NPAR configuration in shmem.
    - Block the CNIC for the current function if there is neither FCoE nor
      iSCSI valid configuration by returning NULL from bnx2x_cnic_probe().

    Broadcom CNIC core network driver: fix mem leak on allocation failures in cnic_alloc_uio_rings()
    
    We are leaking memory in drivers/net/cnic.c::cnic_alloc_uio_rings() if
    either of the calls to dma_alloc_coherent() fail. This patch fixes it by
    freeing both the memory allocated with kzalloc() and memory allocated with
    previous calls to dma_alloc_coherent() when there's a failure.
    
    Thanks to  Joe Perches <joe@perches.com>  for suggesting a better
    implementation than my initial version.

    cnic: Decouple uio close from cnic shutdown
    
    During cnic shutdown, the original driver code requires userspace to
    close the uio device within a few seconds.  This doesn't always happen
    as the userapp may be hung or otherwise take a long time to close.  The
    system may crash when this happens.
    
    We fix the problem by decoupling the uio structures from the cnic
    structures during cnic shutdown.  We do not unregister the uio device
    until the cnic driver is unloaded.  This eliminates the unreliable wait
    loop for uio to close.
    
    All uio structures are kept in a linked list.  If the device is shutdown
    and later brought back up again, the uio strcture will be found in the
    linked list and coupled back to the cnic structures.

    cnic: Defer iscsi connection cleanup
    
    The bnx2x devices require a 2 second quiet time before sending the last
    RAMROD command to destroy a connection.  This sleep wait adds up to a
    long delay when iscsid is serially destroying maultiple connections.
    
    Create a workqueue to perform the final connection cleanup in the
    background to speed up the process.  This significantly speeds up the
    process as the wait time can be done in parallel for multiple connections.

    The current code makes assumptions about the CID (context ID) memory
    space and starting CID that may not be always correct when firmware
    changes.  In particular, BNX2_ISCSI_START_CID may not always be fixed.
    We now calculate cp->max_cid_space and cp->iscsi_start_cid dynamically
    instead of using fixed constants.  The unused cp->max_iscsi_conn is also
    eliminated.

    cnic: Fix cnic_cm_abort() error handling.
    
    Fix the code that handles the error case when cnic_cm_abort() cannot
    proceed normally.  We cannot just set the csk->state and we must
    go through cnic_ready_to_close() to handle all the conditions.  We
    also add error return code in cnic_cm_abort().

    cnic: Return SPQ credit to bnx2x after ring setup and shutdown.
    
    Everytime the iSCSI ring finishes setup or shutdown, we need to return
    the SPQ (slow path queue) credit to the bnx2x driver.  Without this step,
    the SPQ will eventually be full causing iSCSI to fail.  This can happen
    after 3 or 4 MTU changes for example.
    
    Add code to wait for these slow path commands to complete in the RX ring
    and return the SPQ credit to bnx2x.

    drivers/net: Remove unnecessary returns from void function()s
    
    This patch removes from drivers/net/ all the unnecessary
    return; statements that precede the last closing brace of
    void functions.
    
    It does not remove the returns that are immediately
    preceded by a label as gcc doesn't like that.
    
    It also does not remove null void functions with return.
    
    Done via:
    $ grep -rP --include=*.[ch] -l "return;\n}" net/ | \
      xargs perl -i -e 'local $/ ; while (<>) { s/\n[ \t\n]+return;\n}/\n}/g; print; }'

    cnic: Fix NETDEV_UP event processing.
    
    This fixes the problem of not handling the NETDEV_UP event properly
    during hot-plug or modprobe of bnx2 after cnic.  The handling was
    skipped by mistakenly using "else if" to check for the event.
    
    Also update version to 2.0.1.

    cnic: Shutdown iSCSI ring during uio_close.
    
    The iSCSI ring should be shutdown during uio_close instead of uio_open
    for proper operations.  This fixes the problem of the ring getting
    stuck intermittently.

    cnic: Fix locking in init/exit calls.
    
    The slow path ulp_init and ulp_exit calls to the bnx2i driver
    are sleepable calls and therefore should not be protected using
    rcu_read_lock.  Fix it by using mutex and refcount during these
    calls.  cnic_unregister_driver() will now wait for the refcount
    to go to zero before completing the call.

    cnic: Fix symbol_put_addr() panic on ia64.
    
    When the cnic driver tries to grab a symbol from bnx2 when bnx2 is
    running init code, symbol_get() will succeed but symbol_put_addr()
    will hit BUG() a moment later.  module_text_address() fails because
    bnx2 is still in init code.
    
    This is fixed by using symbol_put() instead which does the exact
    opposite of symbol_get().

    cnic: Fix ISCSI_KEVENT_IF_DOWN message handling.
    
    When a net device goes down or when the bnx2i driver is unloaded,
    the code was not generating the ISCSI_KEVENT_IF_DOWN message
    properly and this could cause the userspace driver to crash.
    
    This is fixed by sending the message properly in the shutdown path.
    cnic_uio_stop() is also added to send the message when bnx2i is
    unregistering.

    [SCSI] cnic: Add new Broadcom CNIC driver.
    
    The CNIC driver controls BNX2 hardware rings and resources used by
    iSCSI.  Most hardware resources for iSCSI are separate from those
    used for ethernet networking.
    
    iSCSI uses a separate MAC address and IP address.  The CNIC driver
    creates a UIO interface to handle the non-offloaded packets such as
    ARP, etc in userspace.
